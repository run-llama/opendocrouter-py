# OpenDocRouter Python API library

The Open Doc Router Python library provides convenient access to the OpenDocRouter REST API from any Python 3.9+
application. The library includes type definitions for all request params and response fields,
and offers both synchronous and asynchronous clients powered by [httpx](https://github.com/encode/httpx).

## Documentation

The REST API documentation can be found on [OpenDocRouter]([https://developers.llamaindex.ai/](https://www.opendocrouter.ai/docs)). The full API of this library can be found in [api.md](api.md).

## Installation

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/run-llama/opendocrouter-python.git
```

## Usage

The full API of this library can be found in [api.md](api.md).

```python
import os
from opendocrouter import OpenDocRouter

client = OpenDocRouter(
    api_key=os.environ.get("OPEN_DOC_ROUTER_API_KEY"),  # This is the default and can be omitted
)

parse_result = client.parse.create(
    document={"url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762"},
    model="google/gemini-3-flash",
)
print(parse_result.id)
```

While you can provide an `api_key` keyword argument,
we recommend using [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/)
to add `OPEN_DOC_ROUTER_API_KEY="My API Key"` to your `.env` file
so that your API Key is not stored in source control.

## Async usage

Simply import `AsyncOpenDocRouter` instead of `OpenDocRouter` and use `await` with each API call:

```python
import os
import asyncio
from opendocrouter import AsyncOpenDocRouter

client = AsyncOpenDocRouter(
    api_key=os.environ.get("OPEN_DOC_ROUTER_API_KEY"),  # This is the default and can be omitted
)


async def main() -> None:
    parse_result = await client.parse.create(
        document={"url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762"},
        model="google/gemini-3-flash",
    )
    print(parse_result.id)


asyncio.run(main())
```

Functionality between the synchronous and asynchronous clients is otherwise identical.

### With aiohttp

By default, the async client uses `httpx` for HTTP requests. However, for improved concurrency performance you may also use `aiohttp` as the HTTP backend.

You can enable this by installing `aiohttp`:

```sh
pip install 'opendocrouter[aiohttp] @ git+https://github.com/run-llama/opendocrouter-python.git'
```

Then you can enable it by instantiating the client with `http_client=DefaultAioHttpClient()`:

```python
import os
import asyncio
from opendocrouter import DefaultAioHttpClient
from opendocrouter import AsyncOpenDocRouter


async def main() -> None:
    async with AsyncOpenDocRouter(
        api_key=os.environ.get("OPEN_DOC_ROUTER_API_KEY"),  # This is the default and can be omitted
        http_client=DefaultAioHttpClient(),
    ) as client:
        parse_result = await client.parse.create(
            document={"url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762"},
            model="google/gemini-3-flash",
        )
        print(parse_result.id)


asyncio.run(main())
```

## Using types

Nested request parameters are [TypedDicts](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.TypedDict). Responses are [Pydantic models](https://docs.pydantic.dev) which also provide helper methods for things like:

- Serializing back into JSON, `model.to_json()`
- Converting to a dictionary, `model.to_dict()`

Typed requests and responses provide autocomplete and documentation within your editor. If you would like to see type errors in VS Code to help catch bugs earlier, set `python.analysis.typeCheckingMode` to `basic`.

## Handling errors

When the library is unable to connect to the API (for example, due to network connection problems or a timeout), a subclass of `opendocrouter.APIConnectionError` is raised.

When the API returns a non-success status code (that is, 4xx or 5xx
response), a subclass of `opendocrouter.APIStatusError` is raised, containing `status_code` and `response` properties.

All errors inherit from `opendocrouter.APIError`.

```python
import opendocrouter
from opendocrouter import OpenDocRouter

client = OpenDocRouter()

try:
    client.parse.get(
        id="182bd5e5-6e1a-4fe4-a799-aa6d9a6ab26e",
    )
except opendocrouter.APIConnectionError as e:
    print("The server could not be reached")
    print(e.__cause__)  # an underlying Exception, likely raised within httpx.
except opendocrouter.RateLimitError as e:
    print("A 429 status code was received; we should back off a bit.")
except opendocrouter.APIStatusError as e:
    print("Another non-200-range status code was received")
    print(e.status_code)
    print(e.response)
```

Error codes are as follows:

| Status Code | Error Type                 |
| ----------- | -------------------------- |
| 400         | `BadRequestError`          |
| 401         | `AuthenticationError`      |
| 403         | `PermissionDeniedError`    |
| 404         | `NotFoundError`            |
| 409         | `ConflictError`            |
| 422         | `UnprocessableEntityError` |
| 429         | `RateLimitError`           |
| >=500       | `InternalServerError`      |
| N/A         | `APIConnectionError`       |

### Retries

Certain errors are automatically retried 2 times by default, with a short exponential backoff.
Connection errors (for example, due to a network connectivity problem), 408 Request Timeout, 409 Conflict,
429 Rate Limit, and >=500 Internal errors are all retried by default.

You can use the `max_retries` option to configure or disable retry settings:

```python
from opendocrouter import OpenDocRouter

# Configure the default for all requests:
client = OpenDocRouter(
    # default is 2
    max_retries=0,
)

# Or, configure per-request:
client.with_options(max_retries=5).parse.get(
    id="182bd5e5-6e1a-4fe4-a799-aa6d9a6ab26e",
)
```

### Timeouts

By default requests time out after 1 minute. You can configure this with a `timeout` option,
which accepts a float or an [`httpx.Timeout`](https://www.python-httpx.org/advanced/timeouts/#fine-tuning-the-configuration) object:

```python
import httpx

from opendocrouter import OpenDocRouter

# Configure the default for all requests:
client = OpenDocRouter(
    # 20 seconds (default is 1 minute)
    timeout=20.0,
)

# More granular control:
client = OpenDocRouter(
    timeout=httpx.Timeout(60.0, read=5.0, write=10.0, connect=2.0),
)

# Override per-request:
client.with_options(timeout=5.0).parse.get(
    id="182bd5e5-6e1a-4fe4-a799-aa6d9a6ab26e",
)
```

On timeout, an `APITimeoutError` is thrown.

Note that requests that time out are [retried twice by default](#retries).

## Advanced

### Logging

We use the standard library [`logging`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html) module.

You can enable logging by setting the environment variable `OPEN_DOC_ROUTER_LOG` to `info`.

```shell
$ export OPEN_DOC_ROUTER_LOG=info
```

Or to `debug` for more verbose logging.

### How to tell whether `None` means `null` or missing

In an API response, a field may be explicitly `null`, or missing entirely; in either case, its value is `None` in this library. You can differentiate the two cases with `.model_fields_set`:

```py
if response.my_field is None:
  if 'my_field' not in response.model_fields_set:
    print('Got json like {}, without a "my_field" key present at all.')
  else:
    print('Got json like {"my_field": null}.')
```

### Accessing raw response data (e.g. headers)

The "raw" Response object can be accessed by prefixing `.with_raw_response.` to any HTTP method call, e.g.,

```py
from opendocrouter import OpenDocRouter

client = OpenDocRouter()
response = client.parse.with_raw_response.get(
    id="182bd5e5-6e1a-4fe4-a799-aa6d9a6ab26e",
)
print(response.headers.get('X-My-Header'))

parse = response.parse()  # get the object that `parse.get()` would have returned
print(parse.id)
```

These methods return an [`APIResponse`](https://github.com/run-llama/opendocrouter-python/tree/main/src/opendocrouter/_response.py) object.

The async client returns an [`AsyncAPIResponse`](https://github.com/run-llama/opendocrouter-python/tree/main/src/opendocrouter/_response.py) with the same structure, the only difference being `await`able methods for reading the response content.

#### `.with_streaming_response`

The above interface eagerly reads the full response body when you make the request, which may not always be what you want.

To stream the response body, use `.with_streaming_response` instead, which requires a context manager and only reads the response body once you call `.read()`, `.text()`, `.json()`, `.iter_bytes()`, `.iter_text()`, `.iter_lines()` or `.parse()`. In the async client, these are async methods.

```python
with client.parse.with_streaming_response.get(
    id="182bd5e5-6e1a-4fe4-a799-aa6d9a6ab26e",
) as response:
    print(response.headers.get("X-My-Header"))

    for line in response.iter_lines():
        print(line)
```

The context manager is required so that the response will reliably be closed.

### Configuring the HTTP client

You can directly override the [httpx client](https://www.python-httpx.org/api/#client) to customize it for your use case, including:

- Support for [proxies](https://www.python-httpx.org/advanced/proxies/)
- Custom [transports](https://www.python-httpx.org/advanced/transports/)
- Additional [advanced](https://www.python-httpx.org/advanced/clients/) functionality

```python
import httpx
from opendocrouter import OpenDocRouter, DefaultHttpxClient

client = OpenDocRouter(
    # Or use the `OPEN_DOC_ROUTER_BASE_URL` env var
    base_url="http://my.test.server.example.com:8083",
    http_client=DefaultHttpxClient(
        proxy="http://my.test.proxy.example.com",
        transport=httpx.HTTPTransport(local_address="0.0.0.0"),
    ),
)
```

You can also customize the client on a per-request basis by using `with_options()`:

```python
client.with_options(http_client=DefaultHttpxClient(...))
```

### Managing HTTP resources

By default the library closes underlying HTTP connections whenever the client is [garbage collected](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__del__). You can manually close the client using the `.close()` method if desired, or with a context manager that closes when exiting.

```py
from opendocrouter import OpenDocRouter

with OpenDocRouter() as client:
  # make requests here
  ...

# HTTP client is now closed
```

## Versioning

This library is distributed only from this Git repository. It is not published to PyPI and has no
releases, tags, or changelog, so `pip install git+https://...` always installs the current tip of the
default branch. To pin an exact revision, append a commit SHA:

    pip install 'git+https://github.com/run-llama/opendocrouter-python.git@<commit-sha>'

Backwards-incompatible changes can land on the default branch, so pin a SHA if you need a stable surface.

We are keen for your feedback; please open an [issue](https://www.github.com/run-llama/opendocrouter-python/issues) with questions, bugs, or suggestions.

### Determining the installed revision

`opendocrouter.__version__` is a fixed placeholder (`0.0.1`) and never changes. Because the library
is installed from git, use pip to see which commit you have:

```sh
pip freeze | grep opendocrouter
```

## Requirements

Python 3.9 or higher.
